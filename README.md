# node-red-to-online.wonderware.com
This is a node-red example of sending data to online.wonderware.com's REST API using the JSON format.

It is an intentionnally simple example (without caching, queueing, buffering, store-forward, etc.).

Note: the below image doesn't show at flows.nodered.org nor the does the "view at github" link in the upper right corner because it somehow created a gist.github.com instead of regular github entry and those don't seem to be able to host screen shots.

If you want to see the below screenshot view it on: https://github.com/jtmoderate876/node-red-to-online.wonderware.com
